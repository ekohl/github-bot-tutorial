Preparation
===========

Before coming to the tutorial, please do the following:

1. Have Python 3.7 installed in your laptop. **Note:** It's important
   that you're running Python 3.7 (or above) because we will use some of
   the new features added in 3.7 in this tutorial.

   * `Here's a tutorial that will help you get set up
     <https://realpython.com/installing-python/>`__

2. Create a `GitHub <https://github.com/>`_ account, if you don't already have one.
   If your account has two-factor-authentication enabled, bring that device.
   (Yubikey, your phone).

3. `Request access to GitHub Actions Beta
   <https://github.com/features/actions/signup>`_, if you don't already
   have it. **Note:** This is required for a bonus part of the tutorial
   and may take weeks to get enrolled. It will not prevent you from
   going through the main activities in this tutorial.

4. Create a `Heroku <https://heroku.com>`_ account. Your bot will be deployed to
   Heroku.

5. Install `Heroku Toolbelt <https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#download-and-install>`_.
   (Optional, it can be useful for debugging later).
