Waits for Pull Request related events, as well as ``check_suite`` and
``check_run`` with ``rerequested`` action. Every time PR is updated, it:

  - retrieves and parses the PR diff

  - checks whether it contains additions to changelog fragment files

  - reports intermediate statuses and the final outcome back to GitHub
    using Checks API

  - uses nice visual indication and highlights the details on Checks
    page

  - can be used to block PRs where the author forgot to add a
    change fragment

  - is a GitHub App, unlocking the ability to use certain APIs

  - can be used as a GitHub Action

the-knight-who-says-ni
''''''''''''''''''''''

Waits for incoming CPython's pull requests. Each time a pull request is opened,
it does the following:

  - find out the author's info

  - find out if the author has signed the CLA

  - if the author has not signed the CLA, notify the author

  - if the author has signed the CLA, apply the CLA signed Label

bedevere-bot

  - identify the stage of the pull request, one of:  awaiting review, awaiting merge,
    awaiting change request, awaiting core dev review.

  - apply labels to pull requests

  - checks if the PR contains reference to an issue

  - automatically provide link to the issue in the bug tracker
